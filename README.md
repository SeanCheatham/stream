# A Stream Utility Server

## Purpose
This project aims to provide an easy-to-use, easy-to-deploy server which can stylize live video and record it back to a destination.  It is also an experimental learning endeavor as I venture into OpenCV territory using JavaCPP bindings.

## Status
This project is still in-progress.  None of it is production ready.  The APIs are not stable.  Use at your own risk.  I am building this as a side-project and to suit my own needs.  Feel free to send suggestions my way.

The server implementation is currently in Scala.  Any sort of model training is done using Python, but the hope is to ultimately move that over to Scala as well (i.e. with deeplearning4j).
